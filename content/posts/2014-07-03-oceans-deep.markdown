### Oceans Deep - Sons of day  

Even though the world I'm in  
The perfect pitch this way appears  
The greatest pressures of my sin don't disappear

Although alive and with how much  
The wishing, well I wished for you  
Then I look to see myself within it all

<!--more--> 
My oceans deep my rivers wide  
The strangers weep at pleasures side  
Oh why do I not see the only one unseen


I'm lost without it seems so true  
You left from here from me to you  
Well my heart is broken  
I'm trying can't you see, can't you see

My oceans deep my rivers wide  
The strangers weep at pleasures side  
Oh why do I not see the only one unseen
